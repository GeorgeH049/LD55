# Summoner's Apprentice
This is a game developed solo in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare Game Jam (specifically, LD55). It has the player making use of trial-and-error to work out the rules of summoning, and thanks to its hasty development it is very poorly balanced.

If you find yourself stuck, check out the hints/answers on the Itch page.
